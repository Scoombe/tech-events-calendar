# Django Girls Bangkok

> If you are a woman and want to learn how to make websites, we have good news for you: we are holding a one-day workshop for beginners!

We believe the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become one of us – women programmers!

If you are a woman, know English and have a laptop, you can apply for our event! Don't worry, you don't need to know any technical stuff – our workshop is for people who are new to programming.

As a workshop attendee you will attend a **one-day Django workshop** during which you will create your first website!
